# GestureChef - Smart Recipe Companion 🍳👋  

In today's fast-paced world, we all struggle with one daily question "What should I cook today?" With endless options and limited time, choosing a meal can often be more frustrating than cooking itself! But what if your kitchen could suggest the perfect dish in real-time, based on the time of day?

Introducing the Gesture-Controlled Kitchen Guide, an innovative touch-free cooking assistant designed to make meal selection effortless. Whether it's breakfast, brunch, lunch, snacks, dinner, or even one of your sneaky midnight cravings, this smart device instantly suggests delicious recipes suited to the moment, so you never have to second-guess your next meal again.

Built around a 4.7" E-Ink display, a gesture sensor, and a rechargeable 18650 battery, this sleek, modern device operates with simple hand gestures. No messy touchscreens, no cluttered recipe books, just wave right for a new meal idea, swipe up to reveal step-by-step instructions, and swipe down to return. Plus, with its custom 3D-printed case and magnetic mount, it blends seamlessly into any kitchen setup.

Cooking should be inspiring, not overwhelming. Whether you're a busy professional, a home chef, or someone just looking for meal inspiration, the Gesture-Controlled Kitchen Guide is your perfect kitchen companion.
